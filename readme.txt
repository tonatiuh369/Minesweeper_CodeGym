Minesweeper is a single-player puzzle video game. The objective of the game is to clear a rectangular board containing hidden "mines" or bombs without detonating any of them, with help from clues about the number of neighboring mines in each field. 

You reveal a square with a LEFT CLICK. If it doesn't contain a mine, then a number appears that represents the number of mines adjacent to the revealed space. Now you need to do some thinking and guess which cells can be revealed and which should be marked as mined. And so it continues until you win or explode.
